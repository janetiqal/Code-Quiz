# Name of Assignment 
Code Quiz 
# Purpose
The purpose of this assignment is to build a coding quiz with questions with multiple answer options for users to test their coding knowledge. This assignment requires knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript and Web API's to build a functional, responsive quiz. After a question has been answered the next question should display on the screen. If the user gets a question wrong, time is deducted. If a question is answered correctly a point is added to the users score. When the time runs out or if the user answers all the questions--the user is able to save his/her initials and highscore. 
# My Experience
The first thing I did was structure my html to create the layout of the code quiz. I created a header, tile, and mutlpiple div tags to place the question and the questions answers. I then created variables for them for me to refrence in my javascript file. I built an array called questionsAndOptions that contained a question and the options and correct answer. I knew I could iterate over the questions/answer using their index vaules to propogate through the questions.
