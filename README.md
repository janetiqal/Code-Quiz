# My Experience
The first thing I did was structure my html to create the layout of the code quiz. I created a header, tile, and mutlpiple div tags to place the question and the questions answers. I then created constant variables for them for me to refrence in my javascript file. I built two variables as arrays. Variable for questions, and variable for answers.
